# timer
Because, why not have a Terminal based timer?

timer.sh will take a number of minutes that it will wait before alerting, via the medium of sound, that it's completed.

```bash
$ timer 15
Starting timer with offset 15 mins
Timer will sound at Thu 11 Aug 2016 19:48:59 BST / 1470941339
Time!
```

timer.sh gives you an idea of the expected completion in human readable and epoch time (for the androids amongst us).
